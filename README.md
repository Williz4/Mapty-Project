## Description

Mapty is a web app that allows you to be able to log your workouts. Currently Mapty allows you to log 2 workout activities which are the Running and Cycling workouts. You are able to log the location of the workout and the date too. Mapty also uses the localStorage Api to ensure that previous workouts are available to you when you return to the page.

## How To Interact with the Application

## Known  Bugs
Currently there are no known bugs in Mapty apart from when we lose the protoypal chain when working with OOP and localStorage.

## Technologies Used
I used HTML for the sites structure and CSS for the styling and visual presentation and finally Modern JS concepts (ES6 classes, private fields among others).
